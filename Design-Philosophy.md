# 🎨 CopperlineOS Design Philosophy

CopperlineOS isn’t just an operating system — it’s a statement about clarity, intentionality, and expressive computing.

## Core Principles

- **Determinism**: Every action is predictable. No hidden state, no surprises.
- **Modularity**: Each daemon is a standalone ritual. Replaceable, remixable, and composable.
- **Expressiveness**: The system should feel elegant, intuitive, and responsive — for both users and developers.

## Amiga DNA

CopperlineOS draws inspiration from the Amiga’s:

- Real-time responsiveness
- Hardware-level clarity
- Low-latency media handling
- Modular architecture

This DNA is reimagined for modern hardware, with Rust-based SDKs, Vulkan compositing, and timeline-driven orchestration.

## UX Ethos

- Onboarding should feel like a ritual, not a chore.
- Shell interactions should be expressive, not cryptic.
- Documentation should reflect the system’s elegance.

CopperlineOS is built to resonate — not just run.
